Following approval by the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) Executive Committee on September 11, the 2014 List of Prohibited Substances and Methods is now available.

Noteworthy changes to the List, which will come into force on January 1, 2014, include:

IN – AND OUT-OF COMPETITION

Use of International Non-proprietary Names (INN)

With the assistance of the World Health Organisation, the nomenclature of some substances on the List has been updated to International Non-proprietary Names (INN). For ease, however, previous names have been maintained and no substance has been deleted.

S1. Anabolic Agents

To ensure clarification and accuracy, changes were made to the definitions of “exogenous” and “endogenous”.

S2. Peptide Hormones, Growth Factors and Related Substances

As made clear through points S2.2, S2.3 and S2.4, Releasing factors are prohibited. Furthermore, other prohibited growth factors are listed separately.

S5. Diuretics and other Masking Agents

Vasopressing V2 antagonists (vaptans) were added as an example of a diuretic subclass.

M1. Manipulation of Blood and Blood Components

For the purpose of scientific accuracy, the term allogenic was introduced.

IN-COMPETITION

S6. Stimulants

Some drugs that metabolize to amphetamine or methamphetamine have been reclassified because improved analytical techniques permit the identification of the administered drug and corresponding metabolites; MDMA and MDA are reclassified because they are now recognized as less likely to be used as doping agents; cathinone and its analogues (e.g. mephedrone, methedrone, a- pyrrolidinovalerophenone) and trimetazidine have been added as examples to reflect emerging patterns of drug use.

IN PARTICULAR SPORTS

P1. Alcohol

In the interest of accuracy, changes were made to the wording describing the blood alcohol threshold. In addition, “Aeronautic” has been replaced by “Air Sports”, and “FITA” has been replaced by its new acronym “WA” (World Archery).

P2. Beta-blockers

“FITA” has been replaced by its new acronym “WA” (World Archery).

Monitoring Program

In order to detect potential patterns of abuse, mitragynine has been added to the Narcotics class of the Monitoring Program.

Mobile-friendly formats

In an effort to provide stakeholders with tools to support anti-doping activities and following the successful iPhone application introduced in 2011, the 2014 Prohibited List will again be available on iPhone and other mobile devices as of January 1, 2014.

In addition to English, French and Spanish versions of the List, it is also possible to translate the List into other languages.

Stakeholders who wish to translate the List can do so by November 1, 2013 and send WADA the new version to be inserted in the mobile-friendly platforms at minimal cost.

The FDA has cautioned against using a vitamin B-50 supplement sold online and in stores (Healthy Life Chemistry by Purity First) because it has tested positive for two potentially harmful anabolic steroids — dimethazine and methasterone.

The warning follows 29 reports of supplement-related adverse incidents, including fatigue, myalgia, missed menstruation (in women) and low testosterone (in men). The manufacturer has refused a request to recall the product voluntarily, Reuters reports.

Clinicians should question patients about their dietary supplement use, especially patients displaying warning signs and adverse reactions associated with steroid use (e.g., blood clots, kidney failure, liver injury, stroke).

In a simple, but very significant ceremony, the Vice President of the Puerto Rico Weightlifting Federation, Mr. Jose Delerme, awards three medals to Rusmeris Villar Barbosa (COL) for her victory in the 53kg category at the San Salvador CUP held in 2010. The puertorrican athlete, who won these medals was found with an Adverse Analytical Result, therefore transferred the medals to the rightful owner, Villar from Colombia. Serves as witness the head coach of the Colombian National team, Mr. Osvaldo Pirillo. All this happened during the Pan American Championships 2013 at Isla Margarita, Venezuela.

At its May 11 meeting WADA’s Executive Committee decided to increase the threshold level for cannabis following consideration of the many submissions received from stakeholders during the Code review process.

Accordingly, the Technical Document on Decision Limits for the Confirmatory Quantification of Threshold Substances (TD2013DL) has been revised to reflect the applicable modifications affecting compliance decisions for Carboxy-THC.

Version 2.0 of the TD2013DL is effective as of May 11, 2013, and can be found on WADA’s Web site.

All samples received by laboratories post-May 11 will be subject to the new threshold level.

As a matter of fairness and to provide consistency, WADA advises not to pursue cases currently in the results management phase where the reported concentration is less than the new threshold (150 ng/mL).

Also, for any analyses conducted from May 11 onwards, laboratories are requested not to report any THC case result below the acceptable threshold, regardless of the sample receipt date.

The spirit of sport and anti doping policy: an ideal worth fighting for

Professor MJ McNamee of Swansea University in the UK argues that the ‘spirit of sport’ is an important component of the fight against doping in sport.

In conferences concerning doping and anti-doping over the last few years there has been some criticism of the notion of the ‘spirit of sport’ which – among other things – is at the heart of anti-doping policy.

These discussions can be distilled into two questions: firstly, what is the spirit of sport; and, secondly, how can it be used in anti doping policy? Answers typically take the form of it is too vague a concept, and that it has no use for anti-doping policy.

In this short essay I want to indicate why both of these responses are neither robust nor right, and why the concept is worth fighting for and keeping at the core of the World Anti-Doping Code.

What kind of problem is ‘vagueness’? In philosophical journals much ink has been spilt on the idea of conceptual vagueness and this is not the place to systematically survey that literature. Consider, however, some everyday concepts to see how problematic they really are in terms of vagueness.

When does dawn break? Is it when the penumbra of light breaks the horizon? Or when the first edge of the sun appears? Or is it when the whole of the sun’s globe is in sight? Well suppose we say ‘the latter is too late’. But are we in a position to say with absolute precision which of the former the right meaning? Both seem to be in as good a position as the other.

So the choice is to a certain extent arbitrary; we must come to agree on our judgments about it. Take a more common example: a color spectrum. On that spectrum when does yellow become ochre? Or, when does orange become red? There is no sufficiently determinate place that allows us unequivocally to give the right answer to these questions regarding color words.

Does this mean that there is no right answer? No. Does that mean we ought to avoid the use of color predicates? Again: no. Does it mean that we must make agreements in judgment and in practice? Yes. And, of course, we do this all the time. When we want to paint a room in the house we go to the store and get color cards from different paint brands, we see what they are called, how they compare, and so on. And we reach a decision for a specific purpose; how it will suit the furniture; how it contrasts with the curtains; whether it will reflect enough light and so on.

How does this points relate to the criticisms regarding the concept of the spirit of sport and its importance for anti doping? Well, first, conceptual vagueness is hardly unique and is something we overcome in practical situations every single day. What must be considered are the purposes to which wish the concept to be put and then specify them precisely.

This is one aspect that has not been done with sufficient clarity to date and is properly a job for WADA, as it proceeds through its consultative phases for the 2015 Code. I shall indicate how this might better be done below.

Secondly, when people simply assert that what the spirit of sport means is simply a subjective matter, they are simply wrong. One cannot move from the fact that there is an open-texture to the concept so that there are genuine disputes about its meaning, to the conclusion that everyone has their own concept, which is as valid as the next person’s.

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein demolished this view in the last century. First, he argued that we cannot simply understand language and meaning as a private phenomenon, there are social rules to each which are necessary. If we each invented our own private meanings how would we ever communicate with each other intelligibly?

The second thing he pointed out was that concepts need not have “essences”. Words like game, sport, education, and so on have many meanings that overlap. They don’t simply have an essence that we can distill as the “real” meaning. This is true of the spirit of sport as it is for the whole of our natural languages. Some scientific discourse avoids this problem by simply prescribing a definition: for example, they might say ‘for the purposes of this study we take X to mean Y or Z. Of course the trouble is then that we sometimes cannot easily compare scientific studies because they define the phenomena they are studying. But the ‘contestedness’ of a concept does not lead to its meaning being relative to every language user or culture. This last insight is particularly important for anti-doping policy.

There are three points that will help anti-doping personnel answer these potential criticisms as unjustified. It can be argued that the spirit of sport is an idea that is interpreted in several ways (just like the concept of ‘sport’ itself). So what some critics of the ‘spirit of sport’ criterion say is that the values that WADA lists simply do not define the concept.

The Code lists the following: Health; Excellence in performance; Character and education; Fun and joy; Teamwork; Dedication and commitment; Respect for rules and laws; Respect for self and other Participants; Courage; Community and solidarity.

Here is the first point then: what the Code says is that these characterize the spirit of sport. I think this is an important conceptual difference and not just word-play. Why? Because whether intentionally or not the Code does not claim to define the spirit of sport. It offers a looser account: a characterization.

Secondly, critics complain that the opposite of (at least some of) the values listed are actually what we witness in sport: illness and injury; cheating and disrespect; cowardice; egoism and so on. One does not need to be a sociologist or psychologist of sport to know that it is true that these negative values and vices do arise in sport everywhere just as their opposites do.

That is to say, sports are about human vices and virtues, but also that benefits and risks may also arise in playing them. And that is little more than saying that sports are human practices and humans are both good and bad. We find the same vices in arts, education, finance, politics and so on. So what?

Thirdly, and closely related, the objection that vices and negative values arise in sports is not an overpowering objection for what I shall propose is a misunderstanding of the function of the spirit of sport criterion.

It is my belief that we cannot understand the notion as a mere description of sport, but rather as an ideal. If we think of it in this way, then we will be faced by heterogeneity; sports just are played differently across the world.

Nevertheless, the values and virtues listed characterize sport at its best: this is what we ought to aim for; these are the positive things that have enshrined sports at their best since their modern re-invention and institutionalization in the 19th century.

This, in short, is what anti doping stands for in large part: to defend an ideal account of sport; one which we can be proud of; which can be a properly educational vehicle; which can be a genuinely positive social force in the world.

And that is why the spirit of sport is an ideal worth defending, and worth retaining at the heart of anti doping policy.

IOC disqualifies Russian weightlifter from Athens 2004 following further analysis of stored samples

The Executive Board (EB) of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) today announced that it has disqualified Russian weightlifter Oleg Perepetchenov from the Athens 2004 Olympic Games after further analysis of his stored sample resulted in an adverse analytical finding.

Perepetchenov finished third in the men’s 77kg weightlifting event. The EB has ordered the Russian Olympic Committee to return to the IOC, as soon as possible, the bronze medal and diploma awarded to the athlete.

Upon considering the recommendations of the IOC Disciplinary Commission, composed for this case of Thomas Bach (Chairman), Ser Miang Ng and Gunilla Lindberg, the IOC Executive Board decided:

The athlete, Oleg Perepetchenov, Russia, weightlifting:

(i) is found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation pursuant to article 2.1 of the IOC Anti-Doping Rules applicable to the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad in Athens in 2004 (presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers in an athlete’s bodily specimen),

(ii) is disqualified from the men’s 77 kg weightlifting event where he had placed third at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, and

(iii) shall have his bronze medal and diploma in the above-mentioned event withdrawn.

II. The International Weightlifting Federation (“IWF”) is requested to modify the results of the above-mentioned event accordingly and to consider any further action within its own competence.

III. The NOC of Russia is ordered to return to the IOC, as soon as possible, the medal and diploma awarded to the athlete in relation to the above-mentioned event.

IV. The NOC of Russia shall ensure full implementation of this decision.

The full decision can be found here.

The IOC stores samples for eight years after each edition of the Games so they can be re-tested should more sophisticated detection methods become available or new substances be added to the list of banned substances.

The IOC, in close collaboration with the World Anti-Doping Agency, decided to further analyse a number of samples from the Athens Games as a result of targeted testing based on intelligence and new methods.
