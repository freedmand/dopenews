            <h1>Top Sprinters Test Positive, Jolting Track World</h1>
            <div class="byline">by MARY PILON</div>

            <p>Three of the top sprinters in track and field, including the American Tyson Gay, on Sunday revealed that they had tested positive for banned substances, a new embarrassment for a sport that has had dozens of doping violations in recent years.</p><p>Gay, the best American sprinter over the past decade and a former world champion, said Sunday that he had tested positive. Asafa Powell of Jamaica, a former world-record holder in the 100 meters, said he, too, had failed a drug test. And Sherone Simpson of Jamaica, part of the country&#8217;s Olympic gold-medal-winning relay team, also tested positive, according to her agent. </p><p>The flurry of revelations was a particularly drastic example of the challenges athletics officials face in stamping out doping from the world&#8217;s biggest stages. Doping in track and field has been particularly vexing.</p><p>With races determined by fractions of a second, runners have long looked to any advantage &#8212; banned or not. The prize of international fame and the riches that come with it have created a cat-and-mouse game that shows no sign of slowing.</p><p>On Sunday, Gay acknowledged that he was one of the elite athletes using a banned substance.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any lies,&#8221; Gay told The Associated Press on Sunday. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake.&#8221;</p><p>He added: &#8220;I will take whatever punishment I get like a man. I do realize and respect what I put in my body, and it is my responsibility.&#8221;</p><p>He promised to be honest with antidoping officials &#8220;about everything, everybody I&#8217;ve been with, every supplement I&#8217;ve ever taken, every company I&#8217;ve ever dealt with, everything,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Gay and Powell said they would withdraw from the world championships next month in Moscow. The third sprinter, Simpson, has also tested positive for a banned stimulant, her agent, Paul Doyle, told The Associated Press on Sunday. Simpson won an Olympic gold medal in the women&#8217;s 400-meter relay in 2004 and a silver in 2012. Powell acknowledged Sunday that he tested positive for Oxilofrine, a banned stimulant. In a statement on Twitter, he said that he did not know how he ingested the drug.</p><p>&#8220;I have never knowingly or willfully taken any supplement or substances that break any rules,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am not now &#8212; nor have I ever been &#8212; a cheat. I am reeling from this genuinely surprising result.&#8221;</p><p>The three athletes join a long list of runners who carry asterisks next to their name. Several of the Olympic 100-meter champions, including Ben Johnson, Linford Christie and Justin Gatlin, have served drug suspensions.</p><p>Veronica Campbell-Brown, a two-time Olympic champion at 200 meters from Jamaica, was provisionally suspended in June while antidoping officials ruled on a positive test for a diuretic. A year ago, the sprinter Debbie Dunn withdrew from the United States Olympic track team after a positive test result at the Olympic trials. The American sprinter LaShawn Merritt, who was the 400 meter champion at the Beijing Olympics, served a 21-month ban levied in October 2010 after he failed drug tests that he claimed came from over-the-counter sexual-enhancement pills.</p><p>But perhaps the highest-profile American runner caught doping was Marion Jones, the women&#8217;s 100 and 200 champion from the 2000 Sydney Olympics, who was stripped of the five medals she won in those Games and served time in a federal prison after lying about having taken performance-enhancing substances.</p><p>Gay, 30, was supposed to represent a new day. He was America&#8217;s best hope of catching Usain Bolt, the fastest sprinter in the world.</p><p>He was also one of a handful of athletes to sign a special &#8220;My Victory&#8221; pledge sponsored by the United States Anti-Doping Agency that declared, &#8220;The only sport I believe in is clean sport, sport that is free of all cheating, including doping.&#8221;</p><p>Gay won three gold medals at the 2007 world championships in Osaka, Japan, beating Powell, then the world-record holder, in the 100, and Bolt in the 200.</p><p>Gay holds the American record in the 100, running it in 9.69 seconds. He ran the three fastest 100s in the world this year. He said he tested positive from a May 16 test and would have a backup sample to confirm the results soon. He declined to say what substance he tested positive for, and his representatives did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p><p>Some might see the doping violations as the latest indication that the sport still does not have a grip on the issue. But independent antidoping experts say the frequent doping violations in track and field and cycling are a reflection of those sports&#8217; rigorous testing protocols. The same incentive to cheat exists in other sports, but positive tests might not be as common because testing procedures might not be as stringent.</p><p>The Jamaicans&#8217; positive drug tests are likely to draw fresh scrutiny to Bolt, the world-record holder at 100 meters and 200 meters. Bolt has long denied taking banned substances and earlier this month told reporters that he was clean, saying, &#8220;I welcome people to test me every day if necessary to prove it to the world.&#8221;</p><p>In recent years, a negative test has not necessarily been proof that an athlete did not dope. Jones had long denied using performance-enhancing drugs, and had never had a positive drug test. Lance Armstrong, who won seven straight Tour de France cycling titles and also long denied using performance-enhancers, never officially tested positive. Both later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs.</p><p>In an attempt to rid the sport of doping, track and field officials recently turned to a sophisticated testing system called the biological passport, similar to what is used in cycling. Instead of testing for specific substances, the program monitors athletes&#8217; blood profiles over time to find variations that could indicate the use of performance-enhancing drugs.</p><p>In March, track and field&#8217;s governing body said that it was investigating 17 possible doping cases uncovered by the biological passport program. I.A.A.F. officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Usada issued a statement Sunday in response to Gay&#8217;s interview, saying it &#8220;appreciates his approach to handling this situation and his choice to voluntarily remove himself from the competition while the full facts surrounding his tests are evaluated.&#8221;</p><p>One of Gay&#8217;s coaches, Lance Brauman, said that he was devastated by Gay&#8217;s positive results.</p><p>&#8220;Tyson and I go back a long way,&#8221; Brauman said. &#8220;I take him at his word that he will be open and honest about the whole situation.&#8221;</p><p>Brauman served time in federal prison on charges including making illegal payments of federal work-study money and falsifying his athletes&#8217; academic records, including Gay&#8217;s.</p><p>Brauman said that neither he nor anyone affiliated with his team was the person Gay mentioned who betrayed his trust.</p><p>Gay said he awaited the test results of his B sample, and the specifics of his case remained unclear.</p>
