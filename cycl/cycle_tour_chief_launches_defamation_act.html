            <div class="byline">by STEVEN RAEBURN</div>

            <p>The race director of the Tour Down Under has launched a Supreme Court defamation action against broadcaster SBS over claims he covered up doping in professional cycling.</p><p>Mike Turtur is pursuing SBS for damages, interest and costs.</p><p>The court papers list a series of heads of claim in an online report which Turtur says damaged his reputation.</p><p>He says the report and the published comments suggest he was &#8220;corrupt and rotten to the core, practising or participating in a code of silence about drug cheats in professional cycling, deliberately concealing from the public a positive drug test by a cyclist and bringing shame on Australia's image as a drug free sporting nation.&#8221;</p><p>In the court papers, Turtur the SBS report and a television broadcast by Cycling Central co-presenter Anthony Tan "greatly injured" his reputation and profession and brought him into public "odium, scandal and contempt".</p><p>"Both the website and the program attracted a large audience of visitors and viewers, particularly having a special interest in the sport of cycling," the action states.</p><p>SBS denies the allegations and says the story, comments and broadcast are "not capable of being, and are not, defamatory".</p>
