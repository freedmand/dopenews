            <h1>Tiernan-Locke facing UCI doping inquiry</h1>
            <div class="byline">by ESPN STAFF</div>

            <p>The International Cycling Union (UCI) have asked Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke to explain a potential discrepancy in his biological passport data.</p><p>The Sunday Times report that the 28-year-old Briton, who pulled out of the Road World Championships on Thursday, has been notified of his suspect blood values and is believed to have three weeks to reply.</p><p>Team Sky say Tiernan-Locke will not race again "while his response to the UCI is prepared" and urge he be allowed to do so "in private and without prejudice".</p><p>Tiernan-Locke - who joined Team Sky last October - originally put his withdrawal from the Road World Championships down to a lack of form.</p><p>It is reported that the 2012 Tour of Britain winner's suspect blood values date back to September 2012.</p><p>"We have no doubts over his performance, behaviour or tests at Team Sky and understand any anomaly is in readings taken before he joined the team," Team Sky's statement continued.</p><p>Biological passports are electronic records collating cyclists' urine and blood test results over a period of time.</p><p>New UCI president Brian Cookson said: "It's important that it [the inquiry] is handled properly and with integrity under the processes that are laid down. I certainly won't be interfering in it.</p><p>"I am concerned that it's leaked out because I don't think this information should be in the public domain while someone is being questioned. That's not the same at all as them being guilty and let's see what happens."</p><p>Tiernan-Locke claimed overall wins in the Tour Mediterraneen, Tour du Haut Var and Tour Alsace riding for Endura Racing in the 2012 season.</p>
