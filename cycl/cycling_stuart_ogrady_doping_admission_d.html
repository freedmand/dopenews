            <p>Cycling Australia (CA) says Stuart O'Grady's doping admission is a "real disappointment" but it is confident the sport can regain public confidence.</p><p>O'Grady admitted to using the banned blood-boosting agent EPO before the 1998 Tour de France, the confession coming just three days after he announced his retirement form the sport.</p><p>The 39-year-old had been named in a French Senate inquiry into sports doping, which looked at the 1998 Tour and found the top three finishers, Italian Marco Pantani, Germany's Jan Ullrich and American Bobby Julich, were taking EPO.</p><p>O'Grady, who confirmed to News Limited he used EPO, took the first of his four career Tour stage wins that year in a race that was overshadowed by the Festina doping scandal.</p><p>CA chief executive Graham Fredericks says his organisation was shocked by O'Grady's admission.</p><p>"This is a real disappointment to us as a custodian of the sport," he said.</p><p>"Cycling Australia can only take a fairly hard line in response to this news overnight."</p><p>Reaction to the news O'Grady cheated during his career has been varied, with the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) calling for him to resign from its Athletes' Commission.</p><p>But O'Grady's most recent professional team, GreenEDGE, released a statement supporting his decision to admit to doping, saying that one mistake should not tarnish an exceptional career.</p><p>Fredericks says it is now O'Grady's responsibility to help rebuild the public trust in the sport.</p><p>"Stuart along with a number of other riders in recent decades have kept coming out with constant streams of disclaimers," he said.</p><p>"Now Stuart and those riders have to turn around and really put back that trust into the community and into the public.</p><p>"I think that is going to take a long time."</p><p>Public confidence</p><p>O'Grady's confession adds to the tainted image of professional road cycling, which was left in tatters following Lance Armstrong's fall from grace last year.</p><p>Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles by the cycling's global governing body the UCI, which following the United States Anti-Doping Agency's investigation into systematic doping.</p><p>Australian cycling was not spared in the wake of the Armstrong scandal, with former professionals Matthew White and Stephen Hodge admitting to doping during their respective careers.</p><p>Fredericks believes great gains have been made to restore the trust of the cycling community but he concedes revelations such as O'Grady's admission have stalled the recovery of the sport.</p><p>"It's going to take a long time, particularly at the men's road elite level," he said.</p><p>"Where there is money there is going to be people trying to cheat and that is where it is going to take a long time to restore public confidence."</p><p>Fredericks says he stands by CA's anti-doping measures, highlighting that both O'Grady and White have previously endorsed its testing program.</p><p>"I believe we have a record we can rely on here in Australia," he said.</p><p>"I'm pleased to see comments Stuart has made and comments that even Matt White has made recently was that in their formative years involved in cycling and AIS programs that they were subject to a very strict anti-doping regime."</p>
