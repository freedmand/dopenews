            <h1>Cyclist Andreas Klier admits doping, suspended for six months</h1>
            <div class="byline">by JOHN HENDERSON</div>

            <p>Andreas Klier, a director and former cyclist for Boulder-based Team Garmin-Sharp, has been suspended by USADA for six months for use of EPO during much of his cycling career with a German team from 1999-2006.</p><p>Klier, 37, spent 2001-08 with Team Telekom. The classics specialist lost all his results up to July 21, 2005, which include winning the 2003 Gent-Wevelgem and finishing second in the 2005 Tour of Flanders. He also won Stage 13 of the 2007 Vuelta a Espana.</p><p>In a statement released by Slipstream Sports, which runs Garmin-Sharp, Klier said, "Along the road to the top of the sport, many years ago, I chose the wrong path, and I have been very sorry for it ever since. To everyone both in and out of cycling including my family, the fans, the sponsors, the sport, I love my peers &#8212; especially those who made the right choices &#8212; I am deeply sorry."</p><p>Klier admitted to using EPO, human growth hormone and a prohibited method of blood transfusion.</p><p>Team Garmin-Sharp has become famous for its mandatory weekly drug testing. Klier raced for the team from 2011-13 when it was known as Garmin-Cervelo. He said he did not dope when racing for the Boulder team.</p><p>"I stopped what I was doing and started competing clean well before I ever joined Slipstream, but I am proud today to be a part of an organization that makes racing clean its only priority," he said in the statement. "In my heart and my mind I know that telling the truth about my past to the proper authorities is the right thing to do to continue to help the sport I love move forward. I accept responsibility for the mistakes I made in my past and the punishment that comes along with them."</p><p>Klier's suspension began Aug. 12. The team is preparing for the third annual USA Pro Challenge, which begins Monday in Aspen.</p><p>"I don't play judgmental one way or the other," team CEO Jonathan Vaughters said. My stance is real simple: From the day you join this organization, it's over. That's it. I don't necessarily place much judgment on what's gone on before. I can't control that. I can control what happens now."</p><p>In the statement, Slipstream Sports said, "We support Andreas for telling the truth about his past, a past that pre-dates Slipstream Sports by years, and accepting the consequences that come along with it. Nothing can erase what happened in cycling's history, but we can learn from it."</p><p>"I have seen both worlds of the sport and I believe that today it is in the best place it's ever been," Klier said in a statement. "The young riders racing now have never faced the same choices I did, and I will do everything I can for the rest of my life to help continue to help build the sport that I love."</p>
