The race director of the Tour Down Under has launched a Supreme Court defamation action against broadcaster SBS over claims he covered up doping in professional cycling.

Mike Turtur is pursuing SBS for damages, interest and costs.

The court papers list a series of heads of claim in an online report which Turtur says damaged his reputation.

He says the report and the published comments suggest he was “corrupt and rotten to the core, practising or participating in a code of silence about drug cheats in professional cycling, deliberately concealing from the public a positive drug test by a cyclist and bringing shame on Australia's image as a drug free sporting nation.”

In the court papers, Turtur the SBS report and a television broadcast by Cycling Central co-presenter Anthony Tan "greatly injured" his reputation and profession and brought him into public "odium, scandal and contempt".

"Both the website and the program attracted a large audience of visitors and viewers, particularly having a special interest in the sport of cycling," the action states.

SBS denies the allegations and says the story, comments and broadcast are "not capable of being, and are not, defamatory".

The International Cycling Union (UCI) have asked Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke to explain a potential discrepancy in his biological passport data.
The Sunday Times report that the 28-year-old Briton, who pulled out of the Road World Championships on Thursday, has been notified of his suspect blood values and is believed to have three weeks to reply.
Team Sky say Tiernan-Locke will not race again "while his response to the UCI is prepared" and urge he be allowed to do so "in private and without prejudice".
Tiernan-Locke - who joined Team Sky last October - originally put his withdrawal from the Road World Championships down to a lack of form.
It is reported that the 2012 Tour of Britain winner's suspect blood values date back to September 2012.
"We have no doubts over his performance, behaviour or tests at Team Sky and understand any anomaly is in readings taken before he joined the team," Team Sky's statement continued.
Biological passports are electronic records collating cyclists' urine and blood test results over a period of time.
New UCI president Brian Cookson said: "It's important that it [the inquiry] is handled properly and with integrity under the processes that are laid down. I certainly won't be interfering in it.
"I am concerned that it's leaked out because I don't think this information should be in the public domain while someone is being questioned. That's not the same at all as them being guilty and let's see what happens."
Tiernan-Locke claimed overall wins in the Tour Mediterraneen, Tour du Haut Var and Tour Alsace riding for Endura Racing in the 2012 season.

Armstrong ordered to answer doping questions as legal case closes in

Lance Armstrong is under pressure to reveal more details about his doping past as legal cases against him gather pace.

According to the Associated Press news agency, a Texas judge has ordered Armstrong to provide documents and written answers to a series of questions by the end of September. The case could also reveal if and what Armstrong's former wife Kristin and UCI President Pat McQuaid knew about his doping.

The US-based news agency claims that Nebraska-based Acceptance Insurance Holding is seeking the information on Armstrong's doping as it tries to recover $3 million it paid Armstrong in bonuses between 1999 and 2001.

Armstrong's legal team is fighting the case but has so far been unable to stop the risk that the disgraced Texan could be forced to give sworn testimony about his doping. They have suggested that Acceptance Insurance Holding is engaged in a "harassing, malicious ... fishing expedition" intended to "make a spectacle of Armstrong's doping."

The case has been set for trial in April 2014.

Armstrong is under pressure to detail who helped him dope. Acceptance specifically asks for information on when and how Armstrong's closest friends, advisers, ex-wife and business partners learned of his doping.

The USADA reasoned decision included huge amounts of evidence about Armstrong's doping network, including some on the role of Kristin but Armstrong remained vague about details when he confessed to doping to Oprah Winfrey in January.

Armstrong is tied up in a series of legal battles. He recently settled with the Sunday Times for an undisclosed amount. US Federal prosecutors have joined a whistle-blower lawsuit that seeks to recover more than $30 million in sponsorship money paid to Armstrong by the U.S. Postal Service. SCA Promotions has sued Armstrong for $12 million it paid him in performance bonuses for victory at the Tour de France. A judge in California is also considering a class-action lawsuit by readers of his book 'It's Not About the Bike'.

No positive doping tests at 2013 Tour de France

The CADF (Cycling Anti-Doping Foundation) has confirmed that no positive tests were returned during the 2013 Tour de France. At a press conference in Aigle, at the headquarters of the UCI, the foundation also announced that the number of tests had increased from last year.

“We don't have any adverse findings from the Tour de France this year,” was how CADF Director Francesca Rossi described the situation. However, she stopped short of claiming that it was a clean edition of the race.

In total, 622 pre- and in-competition tests were carried out for the Tour de France with collaboration between the UCI and AFLD, the French Anti-Doping Agency. That number was up on last year, which saw a total of 566 tests over the same period.

Rossi stressed that the testing programme was more dynamic and ‘less predictable’ than in previous years. However, despite Rossi's claim that the testing strategy was a success, no positive tests were found.

During the Tour, 198 biological passport tests were carried out. However, there were only 18 tests for human growth hormone and just two for blood transfusions.

From the urine samples, of which there were 179, 113 were tested for EPO. The number of in-competition EPO tests were down from 2012.

“We changed our strategy,” Rossi said. “It was put in place because we had the collaboration with the AFLD. We were both in the race for ten days together and we collaborated day-by-day. We set up the testing plan with different sources of information. We have information coming from the athlete passport management unit. We had information from the authorities, especially in France, and from WADA.

“We met everyday and we set up the testing plan. We followed the race and adjusted the testing plan based off what was happening in the race. If the stages were flat we pointed our attention on the sprinters. If there were mountains we tested more of the climbers.”

Is this is success or not?

Cyclingnews asked Rossi whether the CADF's strategy could be deemed a success, in light of the lack of positive cases and the fact that a number of doping stories from previous decades have only started to surface.

"Or they're more scared. The perception was that they realised that we were unpredictable. Normally you test the yellow jersey, the winner of the stage and you test a random. But this year we changed our strategy. We were in the hotels in the evenings more."

"It was a Tour without adverse analytical findings. That's the correct definition for me." Rossi rebuffed the suggestion from another journalist that it must have been frustrating not to have a single positive case.

Rossi also confirmed that tests were carried out for AICAR but that the CADF and the UCI were waiting on WADA to determine a threshold limit for the substance. She added that samples would be stored with retrospective testing an option for the future.
 
“We’ve already been testing for AICAR for a long time now. The only problem is that some substances are present in the body, they are naturally there, for example AICAR. So we are working with the WADA in order to establish a cut-off value,” she said.

“We’ve kept samples for future analysis. We’ll do the same with the growth hormone test when that’s validated.”

Independence

Rossi was keen to stress the independence of the CADF’s role within the sport. She and her staff share the same offices with the UCI, and the UCI currently sit on the Foundation Board that manages the testing foundation. Rossi stated that a conflict of interest would not be possible given that labs report all their findings via the ADAMS system that WADA tap into.

Currently with a budget of over 7 million Swiss Francs, Rossi has seen the CADF’s coffers grow substantially, too. The WorldTour team currently contribute just over 2.6 million CHF per annum with the UCI providing 1.1 million. However, Rossi stressed that sharing the same building, and having ties to the UCI had not created any form of conflict.

“In a technological world the location is less important than the people. For me being independent isn’t about your address it’s about the people you have. We are here, in this part of the building that’s dedicated to us and I don’t see any problem in location.”

Brian Cookson, who is challenging current UCI leader Pat McQuaid for the presidency has called for an entirely independent body to run the anti-doping tests within the sport. Rossi has attempted to push for greater independence since taking over in 2010 and motions are in place for a new Foundation Board to be created, however Rossi admitted that her nominations for the new roles must be ratified by the current Foundation Board, which includes the UCI.

Under Rossi’s blueprint for the CADF there would be a president, a lawyer with Swiss based experience, an anti-doping expert and finally an individual with expertise in Swiss finances. She would like to see no UCI influence, although under the WADA code it would still mean that the UCI would have the responsibility of opening any anti-doping violation cases after the CADF had made their recommendations.

Cyclist Andreas Klier admits doping, suspended for six months

Andreas Klier, a director and former cyclist for Boulder-based Team Garmin-Sharp, has been suspended by USADA for six months for use of EPO during much of his cycling career with a German team from 1999-2006.

Klier, 37, spent 2001-08 with Team Telekom. The classics specialist lost all his results up to July 21, 2005, which include winning the 2003 Gent-Wevelgem and finishing second in the 2005 Tour of Flanders. He also won Stage 13 of the 2007 Vuelta a Espana.

In a statement released by Slipstream Sports, which runs Garmin-Sharp, Klier said, "Along the road to the top of the sport, many years ago, I chose the wrong path, and I have been very sorry for it ever since. To everyone both in and out of cycling including my family, the fans, the sponsors, the sport, I love my peers — especially those who made the right choices — I am deeply sorry."

Klier admitted to using EPO, human growth hormone and a prohibited method of blood transfusion.

Team Garmin-Sharp has become famous for its mandatory weekly drug testing. Klier raced for the team from 2011-13 when it was known as Garmin-Cervelo. He said he did not dope when racing for the Boulder team.

"I stopped what I was doing and started competing clean well before I ever joined Slipstream, but I am proud today to be a part of an organization that makes racing clean its only priority," he said in the statement. "In my heart and my mind I know that telling the truth about my past to the proper authorities is the right thing to do to continue to help the sport I love move forward. I accept responsibility for the mistakes I made in my past and the punishment that comes along with them."

Klier's suspension began Aug. 12. The team is preparing for the third annual USA Pro Challenge, which begins Monday in Aspen.

"I don't play judgmental one way or the other," team CEO Jonathan Vaughters said. My stance is real simple: From the day you join this organization, it's over. That's it. I don't necessarily place much judgment on what's gone on before. I can't control that. I can control what happens now."

In the statement, Slipstream Sports said, "We support Andreas for telling the truth about his past, a past that pre-dates Slipstream Sports by years, and accepting the consequences that come along with it. Nothing can erase what happened in cycling's history, but we can learn from it."

"I have seen both worlds of the sport and I believe that today it is in the best place it's ever been," Klier said in a statement. "The young riders racing now have never faced the same choices I did, and I will do everything I can for the rest of my life to help continue to help build the sport that I love."

Zabel admits to doping from 1996 to 2003

Having previously stated he'd only doped once in his career, Erik Zabel told German publication Süddeutsche Zeitung that his doping regimen extended from 1996 through 2003 in an interview to be published on Monday.

Zabel was recently identified as one of the riders who tested positive for EPO at the 1998 Tour de France, which was at odds with his confession in 2007, along with Rolf Aldag, that he'd only used EPO during the first week of the 1996 Tour. Now, the 43-year-old German admits to a much more extensive utilisation of doping products.

"EPO, cortisone, then even blood doping. It was a whole lot," Zabel told Süddeutsche Zeitung.

Zabel related that he started doping in 1996 with EPO, then moved to blood doping once EPO became detectable.

"In 2003 I got a re-infusion before the Tour de France," said Zabel.

Zabel is sorry for having lied at the 2007 press conference where he had stated that he only doped during the 1996 Tour de France but had stopped immediately due to the side-effects of EPO.

"Above all I wanted to keep my life, my dream job as a pro cyclist," said Zabel. "I loved it so much, this sport, the traveling. This egoism, it was simply stronger."

Zabel rode professionally from 1993 to 2008. He won the green jersey at the Tour de France six consecutive times, from 1996 to 2001, plus won 12 stages at the French Grand Tour. Since 2012 he has been a coach at Team Katusha.

Italian Cycling Federation president slams French Senate doping report

The backlash over the French Senate report regarding doping in cycling continued Friday with comments from the president of the Italian Cycling Federation, Renato Di Rocco.

Di Rocco said the Senate’s inquiry was “seedy,” and that it needs to release the names of other athletes from different sports that were also investigated.

A number of cyclists were found to have tested positive for EPO during the 1998 Tour de France, including first- and second-place finishers Marco Pantini and Jan Ullrich. Also on the list is Italian sprinter Mario Cipollini and American Kevin Livingston.

“If the scientific research wants to be credible let’s come out with all the names and the other disciplines,” Di Rocco said in a press release. “If the French Senate considers the inquiry concluded it will make the French anti-doping action weaker and its Anti-doping Agency less credible, highlighting a seedy action, which is specious and media with the only aim of damaging cycling.”

Here’s more from Di Rocco:

Even if everybody knows, I care about saying that in that period the Management Committee of the Italian Cycling Federation wasn’t the same as today. Moreover I have been the General Secretary of the Italian Cycling Federation until the end of 1997, and from the 2005, when I was elected as President, the situation inherited prompted me to create, realize and, even today, carry on, all that concrete actions that brought ‘our’ fight against doping at an higher level than others realities.

Not surprisingly, the Inquiry anti-doping Committee of the French Senate, has indicated cycling as an avant-garde model and example for the others sports for the fight against doping.

I’m also convinced that the past is an integral part of the history of Cycling as well as for other sports. In fact, the scientific research made by the Inquiry Committee, despite being disrespectful of the medical anti-doping procedures, underlines that the results don’t involve only cycling but also many other sports. We are waiting an update of this research.

These days the Disciplinary Committee of the Italian Cycling Federation is inquiring 57 social doctors and we are waiting the results, in order to update our procedures to defend the health of the riders. The same procedures represent doubtless, already today, the best and the most efficient way that the scientific world can guarantee.

Above all, I’m sorry that, in the face of our efforts and for the high prices paid, the healthy and vital cycling world has to suffer in the media level, instead of being supported and appraised for what it has realized. In conclusion, I would like to appeal to all the political and sport institutions to shed lights toward the French authorities.

Cycling: Stuart O'Grady doping admission disappoints governing body

Cycling Australia (CA) says Stuart O'Grady's doping admission is a "real disappointment" but it is confident the sport can regain public confidence.

O'Grady admitted to using the banned blood-boosting agent EPO before the 1998 Tour de France, the confession coming just three days after he announced his retirement form the sport.

The 39-year-old had been named in a French Senate inquiry into sports doping, which looked at the 1998 Tour and found the top three finishers, Italian Marco Pantani, Germany's Jan Ullrich and American Bobby Julich, were taking EPO.

O'Grady, who confirmed to News Limited he used EPO, took the first of his four career Tour stage wins that year in a race that was overshadowed by the Festina doping scandal.

CA chief executive Graham Fredericks says his organisation was shocked by O'Grady's admission.

"This is a real disappointment to us as a custodian of the sport," he said.

"Cycling Australia can only take a fairly hard line in response to this news overnight."

Reaction to the news O'Grady cheated during his career has been varied, with the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) calling for him to resign from its Athletes' Commission.

But O'Grady's most recent professional team, GreenEDGE, released a statement supporting his decision to admit to doping, saying that one mistake should not tarnish an exceptional career.

Fredericks says it is now O'Grady's responsibility to help rebuild the public trust in the sport.

"Stuart along with a number of other riders in recent decades have kept coming out with constant streams of disclaimers," he said.

"Now Stuart and those riders have to turn around and really put back that trust into the community and into the public.

"I think that is going to take a long time."

Public confidence

O'Grady's confession adds to the tainted image of professional road cycling, which was left in tatters following Lance Armstrong's fall from grace last year.

Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles by the cycling's global governing body the UCI, which following the United States Anti-Doping Agency's investigation into systematic doping.

Australian cycling was not spared in the wake of the Armstrong scandal, with former professionals Matthew White and Stephen Hodge admitting to doping during their respective careers.

Fredericks believes great gains have been made to restore the trust of the cycling community but he concedes revelations such as O'Grady's admission have stalled the recovery of the sport.

"It's going to take a long time, particularly at the men's road elite level," he said.

"Where there is money there is going to be people trying to cheat and that is where it is going to take a long time to restore public confidence."

Fredericks says he stands by CA's anti-doping measures, highlighting that both O'Grady and White have previously endorsed its testing program.

"I believe we have a record we can rely on here in Australia," he said.

"I'm pleased to see comments Stuart has made and comments that even Matt White has made recently was that in their formative years involved in cycling and AIS programs that they were subject to a very strict anti-doping regime."
