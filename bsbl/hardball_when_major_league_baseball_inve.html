            <p>They banged on doors, slipped through guard gates and flashed envelopes stuffed with cash. They hired a peddler of performance enhancing substances, paid for stolen documents and canoodled with a potential witness.</p><p>Major League Baseball&#8217;s sleuths, most of them former New York City cops, were described by one witness as &#8220;goons&#8221; with &#8220;big muscles&#8221; who bullied their way across South Florida in a quest to nail players involved in baseball&#8217;s biggest doping scandal.</p><p>In their zeal to clean up the sport, MLB investigators have been accused of discarding the rulebook much like the juiced-up ballplayers they were pursuing.</p><p>As New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez tries to salvage his career and sullied reputation &#8212; the appeal of his 211-game drug suspension was heard this past week in New York &#8212; his spare-no-expense legal team has hammered away at the integrity of MLB&#8217;s case by accusing baseball&#8217;s investigators of &#8220;despicable, unethical and possibly illegal&#8221; tactics. In their latest gambit, they filed suit last Thursday, alleging MLB waged a vendetta against Rodriguez, its highest-paid player.</p><p>Rodriguez, considered a repeat offender of baseball&#8217;s steroid prohibition, and others claim MLB&#8217;s tactics included filing a &#8220;sham&#8221; lawsuit against a slew of people who have never donned a major league uniform, masquerading as cops, friends or process servers to gain access to would-be witnesses, and, allegedly, purchasing private medical records that had been stolen in a parking lot smash-and-grab.</p><p>&#8220;Even if the players broke the rules by using PEDs, that does not excuse baseball&#8217;s misconduct,&#8221; said Miami attorney Jeffrey R. Sonn, who represents Rodriguez&#8217;s cousin, Yuri Sucart. &#8220;If you threaten witnesses and offer bribes to cooperate, it trashes the game just as bad as what they say the players are doing.&#8221;</p><p>Sucart, 51, who lives in South Miami, is on the list of clients of Biogenesis of America, the now-closed Coral Gables anti-aging clinic run that provided professional and high school athletes alike with performance-enhancing drug concoctions. That, plus Sucart&#8217;s family connection to Rodriguez and his link to a previous PED episode involving the third baseman, put him on the radar of baseball investigators.</p><p>Anthony Bosch, who founded Biogenesis, was a much bigger fish. The 50-year-old, who led people to believe he was a doctor but wasn&#8217;t one, initially denied he supplied any athletes with steroids, then changed his story and is now working on MLB&#8217;s team. In exchange for his help, MLB promised to pay him an undisclosed sum of money &#8212; Rodriguez&#8217;s suit claims it is up to $5 million, in monthly installments &#8212; to cover his legal fees and other expenses.</p><p>It also pledged to put in a good word for him with criminal prosecutors investigating the clinic.</p><p>Bosch&#8217;s cooperation, buttressed by documents and other evidence MLB purchased or otherwise collected, led Commissioner Bud Selig to suspend more than a dozen players, including two former Most Valuable Players: Rodriguez and Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun. The players all accepted their penalties except Rodriguez, whose 211-game ban was the harshest punishment. After hearing evidence last week, an arbitrator will decide whether the ban stands.</p>
