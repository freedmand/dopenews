            <h1>Report: Some 20 baseball players may face suspension in doping scandal</h1>
            <div class="byline">by BEN BRUMFIELD</div>

            <p>Major League Baseball is set to suspend some 20 players in the coming weeks due to a scandal involving performance-enhancing drugs, according to an ESPN report that said a key figure in the case is now ready to cooperate with investigators.</p><p>The network says it is potentially the worst drug-abuse case in the history of U.S. sports.</p><p>The league declined to comment to CNN but confirmed that an investigation is in the works.</p><p>The players union said Wednesday that players are being interviewed by baseball officials and are represented by attorneys.</p><p>"The commissioner's office has assured us that no decisions regarding discipline have been made or will be made until those interviews are completed," the union said in a written statement.</p><p>Baseball's highest-paid player, New York Yankee third baseman Alex "A-Rod" Rodriguez, as well as Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, are among those facing suspension, ESPN said, citing unnamed sources.</p><p>Both have denied recently using performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs. Rodriguez has admitted in the past to using banned substances when he played with the Texas Rangers in the early 2000s.</p><p>A-Rod denies performance-enhancing drugs reports</p><p>The league may seek to ban the players for 100 games by counting the doping itself as one infraction and lying about having taken the drugs as a second one, ESPN reported. Major league players can appeal any possible suspensions, as Braun did in 2012.</p><p>That year, a drug test showed high levels of testosterone in his body, but the outfielder successfully disputed the testing process, and the suspension was overturned in February.</p><p>Asked about the ESPN report Tuesday, Braun said he was sticking by his previous account. "The truth has not changed," he told reporters, declining to comment further.</p><p>CNN has not independently confirmed the ESPN report.</p><p>A Florida newspaper first leveled doping allegations at Rodriguez in January. The Miami New Times reported that the shortstop and third baseman had acquired the drugs from a now-closed Miami anti-aging clinic called "Biogenesis," run by Anthony Bosch.</p><p>Twitter reacts to PED saga</p><p>ESPN said Bosch, who allegedly supplied baseball players with performance-enhancing substances, has agreed to cooperate in the MLB investigation. CBS Sports also confirmed Bosch will talk to investigators.</p><p>Records obtained by MLB name many players, but league investigators need Bosch to attest to their accuracy and confirm that players were doping, ESPN reported, citing unnamed sources.</p><p>The league filed a suit against Biogenesis in March for allegedly supplying PEDs to players and advising them on how to avoid detection during drug tests.</p><p>ESPN reported that MLB may drop the suit against Bosch, if he cooperates in its investigation.</p><p>MLB sues Florida clinic linked to supplying players with PEDs</p><p>Managers tight-lipped</p><p>On Tuesday, the managers for the Yankees and the Brewers said little.</p><p>"I know Major League Baseball is handling it, and that's all I know," Brewers manager Ron Roenicke told journalists at a post-game news conference in Milwaukee.</p><p>Yankees manager Joe Girardi started out dodging reporters who grilled him on ESPN's report after New York's game but softened when it came to his concerns about Rodriguez.</p><p>"I always worry about my players, always," he said. "One thing you never want to forget is -- they're human beings."</p><p>In January: MLB expands testing for HGH, testosterone</p><p>He did not say whether he had discussed the looming scandal with Rodriguez.</p><p>"When I talk to Alex, it's baseball-related. That's what it is," Girardi said.</p><p>He feared the game he has dedicated his life to will suffer because of the scandal.</p><p>"I worry about baseball being affected as a game, the whole thing, and what it's been through in the last 15 years."</p><p>What we've learned: A complete timeline</p><p>Rodriguez was at the Yankees training facility in Florida on Tuesday, recovering from an injury. He could not be reached for comment. A 100-game suspension could cost him more that $15 million, ESPN reported.</p><p>New York outfielder Vernon Wells was discouraged by the scandal.</p><p>"We've done so much as a group to try to rid ourselves of conversations like this," he said.</p><p>In spite of advances in drug testing, new doping techniques designed to avoid detection keep coming, Wells said.</p><p>"There's always someone out there trying to beat the system from a medical standpoint."</p>
