            <p>SAN FRANCISCO &#8212; A new report issued Tuesday says Major League Baseball is targeting some of the biggest names in the game in the latest doping scandal.</p><p>The report released by ESPN included numerous suspects. Locally, Oakland A's pitcher Bartolo Colon topped the list. The 40-year-old right-hander has already been suspended once for performance enhancers.</p><p>Other players named in the report include former MVP Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers -- who got out of a suspension because of a technicality after the 2011 season -- and New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez, who has admitted using steroids in the past.</p><p>Additional players implicated in this latest scandal were Rangers outfielder Nelson Cruz and former A's lefty Gio Gonzalez, who now plays with the Washington Nationals.</p><p>All the players have ties to a South Florida clinic that allegedly supplied the performance-enhancing drugs.</p><p>At AT&T Park Tuesday night, the Giants were taking on the Blue Jays and a former teammate who is one of the men named in that report.</p><p>Melky Cabrera played for the Giants last season, but moved on to Toronto.</p><p>MLB suspended him for 50 games last year for using banned substances. Now he may be among the 20 or so athletes looking at 100 game suspensions.</p><p>Before Tuesday night's game as Melky Cabrera took batting practice, word spread at the ball park that the onetime Giants fan favorite was at the center of the latest performance enhancing drug scandal.</p><p>"I heard people talking about that," said Giants fan Jack Ferrari, who brought his son and his son's friends to the game.</p><p>Ferrari said this is just the latest in a string of major league disappointments for the boys he was with.</p><p>"They pretty much followed it on their own," explained Ferrari. "They're old enough to read about it and stuff, so they can make a decision to not like him or not."</p><p>ESPN is reporting Cabrera is one of 20 or so players Major League Baseball is investigating in connection with the now closed Biogenesis of America facility in South Florida.</p><p>The cable sports network reported that founder Tony Bosch reached an agreement to cooperate with MLB's investigation.</p><p>MLB is reportedly seeking 100 game suspensions for players involved.</p><p>Fans at AT&T Park Tuesday night were divided. Blue Jays fan Chris Lieskovsky flew in from Canada to watch the game. He argued performance enhancing drugs can't help if the player doesn't have talent.</p><p>"Eye-hand coordination has got to be there, so steroids only help to a certain extent, you know?" said Lieskovsky. "The rest of it's skill."</p><p>But others said cheaters deserve punishment.</p><p>"It's sad, but if you're using a sports performance drug, I think you should be suspended," said Giant's fan Jenny Foster.</p><p>The founder of Biogensis Bosch could begin meeting with MLB investigators this week. An announcement of suspensions could come before the end of the month.</p><p>The MLB players would have the right to contest the charges, even confronting witnesses and disputing evidence in a process similar to arbitration.</p>
