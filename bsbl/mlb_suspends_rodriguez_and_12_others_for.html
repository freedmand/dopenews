            <h1>M.L.B. Suspends Rodriguez and 12 Others for Doping</h1>
            <div class="byline">by STEVE EDER</div>

            <p>Alex Rodriguez was among 13 players suspended by Major League Baseball on Monday for violating the league&#8217;s antidoping rules, the biggest single-day drug action in the sport&#8217;s history.</p><p>Rodriguez is planning to appeal his ban, which would begin Thursday and would be for 211 games, through the 2014 season &#8212; by far the longest levied by the league for a doping violation. The league cited his &#8220;use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited, performance-enhancing substances&#8221; over many years.</p><p>As baseball announced its sanctions, Rodriguez, the Yankees&#8217; high-profile third baseman, was preparing to make his 2013 major league debut Monday night against the Chicago White Sox. Rodriguez, who has been recovering from hip surgery and a quadriceps strain, is eligible to play until his appeal is heard by an arbitrator, meaning he can probably play out the season with a lengthy possible ban looming.</p><p>In a news conference before the Yankees&#8217; game in Chicago, Rodriguez declined to discuss the suspension or accusations that he used banned substances, but he reiterated his intent to challenge the league&#8217;s ruling.</p><p>Once considered among the best players in the game, Rodriguez received a far stiffer penalty than the others cited by baseball on Monday, who all accepted 50-game suspensions, effectively ending their 2013 seasons. Among the others were three 2013 All-Stars &#8212; Nelson Cruz of the Texas Rangers, Everth Cabrera of the San Diego Padres and Jhonny Peralta of the Detroit Tigers &#8212; as well as Francisco Cervelli of the Yankees.</p><p>Rodriguez is the only player planning to appeal, and the executive director of the players union, Michael Weiner, called his suspension &#8220;way too harsh.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never had a 200-plus penalty for a player who may have used drugs, and you know, among other things, I just think that is way out of line,&#8221; Weiner said in a call with reporters.</p><p>Commissioner Bud Selig, however, said the suspension was within the bounds of the league&#8217;s antidoping rules, saying in a statement that baseball &#8220;conducted a thorough, aggressive investigation guided by facts so that we could justly enforce our rules.&#8221;</p><p>Weiner said a ruling on the appeal was not likely before November, which means Rodriguez can presumably play through the rest of the season.</p><p>The suspensions issued Monday stem from the league&#8217;s investigation into Biogenesis of America, a South Florida anti-aging clinic run by Anthony P. Bosch. With Bosch&#8217;s cooperation, baseball claimed its biggest trophies in its fight against performance-enhancing drugs.</p><p>For the past six months, since Miami New Times, a weekly newspaper, published its account of Bosch&#8217;s providing drugs to professional athletes, including Rodriguez, baseball investigators have intensified their pursuit, going door to door in the Miami area hunting for information to build cases against some of the biggest names in the game.</p><p>Major League Baseball was able to persuade almost all the players linked to Biogenesis to accept their punishments despite the apparent lack of a positive test for banned substances. Baseball&#8217;s drug-testing program, agreed to by the players union, allows for suspensions based on nonanalytic positives when doping can be proved with other evidence. The league contends that its investigation yielded other convincing evidence &#8212; like documents and eyewitness accounts &#8212; that implicates the players.</p><p>The first of the Biogenesis-related suspensions came last month, when the Milwaukee Brewers slugger Ryan Braun accepted a 65-game suspension without appealing. Braun, the National League&#8217;s most valuable player in 2011, failed a drug test that season, but that suspension was overturned on appeal.</p><p>Some of the players punished Monday issued statements acknowledging their mistakes, and their teams publicly stated their support for the league&#8217;s doping program.</p><p>The Yankees said in a statement they would have no comment on the Rodriguez case as it is appealed.</p><p>Rodriguez, who was born in New York and grew up in the Dominican Republic and in Florida, has long been under suspicion for using performance-enhancing drugs, which he admitted using for a limited time earlier in his career.</p><p>At the start of the 2009 season, Rodriguez was 33 and had 553 career home runs, putting him on track to break Barry Bonds&#8217;s career record of 762 by the time Rodriguez reached 40.</p><p>As part of the $275 million contract the Yankees negotiated with Rodriguez a year earlier, the club agreed to pay him several million dollars to secure all the rights to market his home run chase, which they believed would be a commercial bonanza. Rodriguez was thought to be on a pace to pass Willie Mays (660 homers), Babe Ruth (714), Hank Aaron (755) and finally Bonds on the career list.</p><p>At the time, it seemed that Rodriguez&#8217;s breaking the home run record would provide a powerful sign of how baseball had moved beyond the so-called steroids era and would be an important milestone for Selig, who is keenly aware of his legacy and has been criticized for his seeming ambivalence to the issue of doping during the first part of his tenure.</p><p>But in early February 2009, Rodriguez&#8217;s image as the game&#8217;s pristine slugger was shattered. Sports Illustrated published an article that asserted he was among the players who had tested positive in 2003 for performance-enhancing drugs. That test was designed as an anonymous survey and carried no penalties.</p><p>Rodriguez subsequently admitted that he had used steroids from 2001 to 2003 &#8212; before he played for the Yankees. That prompted Selig to order his investigators to interview Rodriguez about his drug use. In that interview, Rodriguez maintained that he never used drugs after 2003, the last year players did not face penalties for a positive drug test.</p><p>Selig and the investigators were not convinced that Rodriguez was truthful, but they had no grounds to suspend him because they could not prove he had been lying.</p><p>As suspicions about Rodriguez&#8217;s use of banned substances persisted, his play declined in recent years and he sustained injuries that jeopardized his chase of Bonds&#8217;s record.</p><p>Baseball investigators believe that Rodriguez&#8217;s ties to Bosch extend back to 2010, and that the banned substances he used included testosterone and human growth hormone.</p><p>In 2011, Rodriguez played in only 99 games, hitting 16 home runs. In 2012, he hit 18 homers and missed six weeks with a broken hand. In the playoffs, he was benched for poor play.</p><p>Rodriguez&#8217;s apparent resumption of his career while he appeals his suspension, coupled with the other punishments issued Monday, will affect the rest of the baseball season. The developments also played a role in moves made at the trade deadline last month. For example, the Tigers dealt for a shortstop who would replace Peralta, expecting his suspension.</p><p>The other players suspended were Antonio Bastardo of the Philadelphia Phillies, Jordany Valdespin and Cesar Puello of the Mets, Jesus Montero of the Seattle Mariners, Fautino de los Santos of the Padres, Sergio Escalona of the Houston Astros, Fernando Martinez of the Yankees and the free-agent pitcher Jordan Norberto. Among the players, only Puello has never played in the major leagues.</p><p>In recent months, the continuing investigation and Rodriguez&#8217;s injury have prompted a back-and-forth between Rodriguez and the Yankees amounting to a public fight.</p><p>On Monday, the Yankees said they felt compelled to address several recent accusations, including Rodriguez&#8217;s saying Friday during his rehabilitation assignment that he believed the Yankees and baseball were conspiring against his return.</p><p>A statement by the Yankees read, &#8220;The New York Yankees in no way instituted and/or assisted MLB in the direction of this investigation; or used the investigation as an attempt to avoid its responsibilities under a player contract; or did its medical staff fail to provide the appropriate standard of care to Alex Rodriguez.&#8221;</p>
