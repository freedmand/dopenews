            <p>Following approval by the World Anti-Doping Agency&#8217;s (WADA) Executive Committee on September 11, the 2014 List of Prohibited Substances and Methods is now available.</p><p>Noteworthy changes to the List, which will come into force on January 1, 2014, include:</p><p>IN &#8211; AND OUT-OF COMPETITION</p><p>Use of International Non-proprietary Names (INN)</p><p>With the assistance of the World Health Organisation, the nomenclature of some substances on the List has been updated to International Non-proprietary Names (INN). For ease, however, previous names have been maintained and no substance has been deleted.</p><p>S1. Anabolic Agents</p><p>To ensure clarification and accuracy, changes were made to the definitions of &#8220;exogenous&#8221; and &#8220;endogenous&#8221;.</p><p>S2. Peptide Hormones, Growth Factors and Related Substances</p><p>As made clear through points S2.2, S2.3 and S2.4, Releasing factors are prohibited. Furthermore, other prohibited growth factors are listed separately.</p><p>S5. Diuretics and other Masking Agents</p><p>Vasopressing V2 antagonists (vaptans) were added as an example of a diuretic subclass.</p><p>M1. Manipulation of Blood and Blood Components</p><p>For the purpose of scientific accuracy, the term allogenic was introduced.</p><p>IN-COMPETITION</p><p>S6. Stimulants</p><p>Some drugs that metabolize to amphetamine or methamphetamine have been reclassified because improved analytical techniques permit the identification of the administered drug and corresponding metabolites; MDMA and MDA are reclassified because they are now recognized as less likely to be used as doping agents; cathinone and its analogues (e.g. mephedrone, methedrone, a- pyrrolidinovalerophenone) and trimetazidine have been added as examples to reflect emerging patterns of drug use.</p><p>IN PARTICULAR SPORTS</p><p>P1. Alcohol</p><p>In the interest of accuracy, changes were made to the wording describing the blood alcohol threshold. In addition, &#8220;Aeronautic&#8221; has been replaced by &#8220;Air Sports&#8221;, and &#8220;FITA&#8221; has been replaced by its new acronym &#8220;WA&#8221; (World Archery).</p><p>P2. Beta-blockers</p><p>&#8220;FITA&#8221; has been replaced by its new acronym &#8220;WA&#8221; (World Archery).</p><p>Monitoring Program</p><p>In order to detect potential patterns of abuse, mitragynine has been added to the Narcotics class of the Monitoring Program.</p><p>Mobile-friendly formats</p><p>In an effort to provide stakeholders with tools to support anti-doping activities and following the successful iPhone application introduced in 2011, the 2014 Prohibited List will again be available on iPhone and other mobile devices as of January 1, 2014.</p><p>In addition to English, French and Spanish versions of the List, it is also possible to translate the List into other languages.</p><p>Stakeholders who wish to translate the List can do so by November 1, 2013 and send WADA the new version to be inserted in the mobile-friendly platforms at minimal cost.</p><p>For more information, please contact: gro.ama-adaw@ofni</p><p>To consult the 2014 Prohibited List, the 2014 Monitoring Program, a summary of modifications on the 2014 List, and a Q&A on any changes, please click here.</p>
