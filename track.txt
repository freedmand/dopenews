KINGSTON, Jamaica, October 3, 2013, CMC - Veronica Campbell-Brown, one of Jamaica's most decorated athletes, has been found guilty by the three-member Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA) Disciplinary Committee.

However, the panel, which sat last month, has recommended a warning to be imposed on the athlete in these circumstances.

At the Jamaica International Invitational held on May 4 at the National Stadium, Campbell-Brown tested positive for a banned substance, regarded as a masking agent for performance-enhancing substances.

Campbell-Brown was represented at the hearing by former Jamaican Prime Minister and attorney P.J. Patterson as well as Howard Jacobs, an attorney who is based overseas.

The 31-year-old superstar who has won 16 medals for Jamaica at the Olympic and World Championships level, sought to clear her name after the presence of a banned diuretic was found in her system resulting in a provisional suspension pending the outcome of the hearing.

The oddest news of the day comes from the Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA) in Italy, where a distance runner attempted to cheat a doping test by using a "fake penis" after a road 10,000-meter race this weekend. 

"Devis Licciardi, an athlete for the Italian Air Force team, allegedly filled up a fake penis with urine uncontaminated by banned substances and tried to use it during a test at the race to proclaim Italy's 10km road-running champion at Molfetta, near Bari." via ANSA

Licciardi finished in last place in the 5,000-meter run at the 49th Palio Citta della Quercia in Italy, where he ran 13:59.16. 

Not related to running, but a St. Louis area man also attempted to pass a drug test by using a fake organ in March. He now faces a felony charge for doing so. The device used is called a Whizzinator, which can be purchased online and mailed discreetly for personal use. 

The World Anti-Doping Agency will hold its 2013 Conference on Doping in Sports from November 12 to 15 in Johannesburg. In the meantime, Licciardi will go before the Comitato Olimpico Nationale Italiano, the Italian Olympic Commitee, for a disciplinary hearing in Rome.

USA Track & Field faces latest doping scandal

Tyson Gay felt healthy for the first time in years and was aiming high: He planned to step on the track at world championships and push Usain Bolt.

Not so fast.

The anticipated 100-meter showdown got scrubbed after Gay, the American record holder in the event, failed a drug test for a banned substance.

That revelation came Sunday, within hours of more bad news for track and field: Asafa Powell, the one-time world-record holder at 100 meters, and his Jamaican teammate, three-time Olympic medalist Sherone Simpson, tested positive for prohibited stimulants.

A sport that vowed it had cleaned itself up after decades of stories about disgraced, drug-fueled sprinters — Ben Johnson, Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery, to name a few — found itself in a very similar spot after this latest flurry of doping cases.

"A sad day," said Doug Logan, the former CEO at Indianapolis-based USA Track and Field. "But I don't see anything on the horizon that says this will be abated in any way."

Gay chose to withdraw from next month's world championships while his case with the United States Anti-Doping Agency plays out; the next step is a test of his "B'' sample, which could come as early as this week. Simpson's and Powell's status remains in limbo. Simpson was eligible for the 100, while Powell was waiting to see if he'd make the relay team.

"Will this be a cloud over (worlds)? I think it would be naive to say otherwise," said Ato Boldon, a four-time Olympic medalist and sprint analyst. "I sat down and thought about the events I'm looking forward to. There are people who are not there, for all the wrong reasons. ..."

Long considered a nonconforming pot-stirrer, Logan recently wrote a column arguing that the fight against performance-enhancing drugs in sports should be surrendered because, in his view, anti-doping rules make very little headway against a problem that never seems to disappear. He said Sunday's onslaught of failed tests only bolstered his point.

"People ought to open up their eyes and see that there's very little we're doing that is keeping those who are motivated to use the substances from using them," Logan said.

The sprinters, meanwhile, offered apologies while also claiming extenuating circumstances.

"I am not now — nor have I ever been — a cheat," Powell said on his Twitter account.

The 30-year-old sprinter, whose 100-meter record of 9.74 seconds stood until Jamaican teammate Bolt beat it in 2008, was calling for an investigation as to how a stimulant called oxilofrine entered his system and caused a positive test at Jamaica's national championships in June.

Simpson, who tested positive for the same stimulant, said she "would not intentionally take an illegal substance of any form into my system."

Gay was more contrite, though he also wasn't taking full responsibility.

"I don't have a sabotage story. I don't have any lies. I don't have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake or it was on USADA's hands, someone playing games," said Gay, who fought back sobs in a telephone interview. "I don't have any of those stories. I basically put my trust in someone and I was let down."

Gay was healthy again this season after being plagued by hamstring and groin ailments, along with a bad hip that required surgery.

He conceded this news would be tough for his fans.

"My reputation," Gay said, "has always been honest."

The 30-year-old, who won the world championship in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay in 2007, took part in the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's "My Victory" program — in which athletes volunteer for enhanced testing to prove they're clean — and his results never raised red flags.

That changed after results of an out-of-competition test on May 16 came back positive. Neither Gay nor USADA CEO Travis Tygart would identify the banned substance.

Generally, first-time offenders are hit with two-year bans, though reduced penalties are sometimes given if there are extenuating circumstances, which both Gay and his coach, Lance Brauman, said there were.

"He mentioned that he (trusted) someone and that person was untrustworthy at the end the day," Brauman told The Associated Press in a phone interview. "Maybe I'm naive, but I believe him."

Max Siegel, the CEO of USA Track and Field, said in a statement: "It is not the news anyone wanted to hear, at any time, about any athlete." He said he looked to USADA to handle the case "appropriately."

While Gay's case gets sorted out on U.S. turf, the positives recorded by Powell and Simpson are part of a bigger doping crisis hitting Jamaica, the home of Bolt and the country that has won 28 medals over the last three Olympics.

In Sunday's editions, The Gleaner newspaper of Jamaica reported that five athletes had tested positive. Paul Doyle, the agent who represents Powell and Simpson, confirmed to the AP that his sprinters were among them. Shortly after Doyle's confirmation, Powell and Simpson each released statements acknowledging the positive tests.

The news stirred up angst on the island, where success on the track is a point of pride, but the rigor of the country's anti-doping program is under constant scrutiny.

"This does not augur well for track and field globally," said Rashalee Mitchell, a 29-year-old assistant social sciences lecturer at Jamaica's campus of the University of the West Indies. "It is fast serving to taint ... our proud and long-standing reputation of producing strong, excellent, raw, homegrown talent that has excelled on the world stage without any drug-related enhancement."

The news came a month after another Jamaican Olympic gold medalist, Veronica Campbell-Brown, tested positive for a banned diuretic.

Campbell-Brown is being suspended while a disciplinary panel reviews her case. Track's governing body said the case appeared to involve a "lesser" offense, which could mean a reduced sentence for the 200-meter champion at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.

Shortly after news of Campbell-Brown's positives, her agent, Claude Bryan, said his client is not a cheat and she does not accept "guilt of willfully taking a banned substance."

Turns out, she's not the only one making that claim during what is turning into another summer of discontent for track and field.

"The one thing I am proud of is, unlike other sports, we have quite a good record, of no matter how big you are, you can get busted if you're not doing things the right way, according to the rules," Boldon said. "This is not a sport where if you're a big name, necessarily, you're protected."

Top Sprinters Test Positive, Jolting Track World

Three of the top sprinters in track and field, including the American Tyson Gay, on Sunday revealed that they had tested positive for banned substances, a new embarrassment for a sport that has had dozens of doping violations in recent years.

Gay, the best American sprinter over the past decade and a former world champion, said Sunday that he had tested positive. Asafa Powell of Jamaica, a former world-record holder in the 100 meters, said he, too, had failed a drug test. And Sherone Simpson of Jamaica, part of the country’s Olympic gold-medal-winning relay team, also tested positive, according to her agent. 

The flurry of revelations was a particularly drastic example of the challenges athletics officials face in stamping out doping from the world’s biggest stages. Doping in track and field has been particularly vexing.

With races determined by fractions of a second, runners have long looked to any advantage — banned or not. The prize of international fame and the riches that come with it have created a cat-and-mouse game that shows no sign of slowing.

On Sunday, Gay acknowledged that he was one of the elite athletes using a banned substance.

“I don’t have any lies,” Gay told The Associated Press on Sunday. “I don’t have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake.”

He added: “I will take whatever punishment I get like a man. I do realize and respect what I put in my body, and it is my responsibility.”

He promised to be honest with antidoping officials “about everything, everybody I’ve been with, every supplement I’ve ever taken, every company I’ve ever dealt with, everything,” he said.

Gay and Powell said they would withdraw from the world championships next month in Moscow. The third sprinter, Simpson, has also tested positive for a banned stimulant, her agent, Paul Doyle, told The Associated Press on Sunday. Simpson won an Olympic gold medal in the women’s 400-meter relay in 2004 and a silver in 2012. Powell acknowledged Sunday that he tested positive for Oxilofrine, a banned stimulant. In a statement on Twitter, he said that he did not know how he ingested the drug.

“I have never knowingly or willfully taken any supplement or substances that break any rules,” he said. “I am not now — nor have I ever been — a cheat. I am reeling from this genuinely surprising result.”

The three athletes join a long list of runners who carry asterisks next to their name. Several of the Olympic 100-meter champions, including Ben Johnson, Linford Christie and Justin Gatlin, have served drug suspensions.

Veronica Campbell-Brown, a two-time Olympic champion at 200 meters from Jamaica, was provisionally suspended in June while antidoping officials ruled on a positive test for a diuretic. A year ago, the sprinter Debbie Dunn withdrew from the United States Olympic track team after a positive test result at the Olympic trials. The American sprinter LaShawn Merritt, who was the 400 meter champion at the Beijing Olympics, served a 21-month ban levied in October 2010 after he failed drug tests that he claimed came from over-the-counter sexual-enhancement pills.

But perhaps the highest-profile American runner caught doping was Marion Jones, the women’s 100 and 200 champion from the 2000 Sydney Olympics, who was stripped of the five medals she won in those Games and served time in a federal prison after lying about having taken performance-enhancing substances.

Gay, 30, was supposed to represent a new day. He was America’s best hope of catching Usain Bolt, the fastest sprinter in the world.

He was also one of a handful of athletes to sign a special “My Victory” pledge sponsored by the United States Anti-Doping Agency that declared, “The only sport I believe in is clean sport, sport that is free of all cheating, including doping.”

Gay won three gold medals at the 2007 world championships in Osaka, Japan, beating Powell, then the world-record holder, in the 100, and Bolt in the 200.

Gay holds the American record in the 100, running it in 9.69 seconds. He ran the three fastest 100s in the world this year. He said he tested positive from a May 16 test and would have a backup sample to confirm the results soon. He declined to say what substance he tested positive for, and his representatives did not respond to a message seeking comment.

Some might see the doping violations as the latest indication that the sport still does not have a grip on the issue. But independent antidoping experts say the frequent doping violations in track and field and cycling are a reflection of those sports’ rigorous testing protocols. The same incentive to cheat exists in other sports, but positive tests might not be as common because testing procedures might not be as stringent.

The Jamaicans’ positive drug tests are likely to draw fresh scrutiny to Bolt, the world-record holder at 100 meters and 200 meters. Bolt has long denied taking banned substances and earlier this month told reporters that he was clean, saying, “I welcome people to test me every day if necessary to prove it to the world.”

In recent years, a negative test has not necessarily been proof that an athlete did not dope. Jones had long denied using performance-enhancing drugs, and had never had a positive drug test. Lance Armstrong, who won seven straight Tour de France cycling titles and also long denied using performance-enhancers, never officially tested positive. Both later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs.

In an attempt to rid the sport of doping, track and field officials recently turned to a sophisticated testing system called the biological passport, similar to what is used in cycling. Instead of testing for specific substances, the program monitors athletes’ blood profiles over time to find variations that could indicate the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

In March, track and field’s governing body said that it was investigating 17 possible doping cases uncovered by the biological passport program. I.A.A.F. officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Usada issued a statement Sunday in response to Gay’s interview, saying it “appreciates his approach to handling this situation and his choice to voluntarily remove himself from the competition while the full facts surrounding his tests are evaluated.”

One of Gay’s coaches, Lance Brauman, said that he was devastated by Gay’s positive results.

“Tyson and I go back a long way,” Brauman said. “I take him at his word that he will be open and honest about the whole situation.”

Brauman served time in federal prison on charges including making illegal payments of federal work-study money and falsifying his athletes’ academic records, including Gay’s.

Brauman said that neither he nor anyone affiliated with his team was the person Gay mentioned who betrayed his trust.

Gay said he awaited the test results of his B sample, and the specifics of his case remained unclear.
