**The #1 Doping and Performance-Enhancing Drugs Sports News Site**

Dope News is a small website that shows news articles I scraped from the Internet related to sports doping. The code is fairly minimalist and clean, and all the html source for the articles and sidebar links was dynamically generated with news_creator.py, a Python script I wrote.

All content is static. In addition to writing html, css, and Python, I created the logo, syringe, and pill icons for the site completely independently using Inkscape, a vector graphics program (proof: http://freedmand.com/syringe_vector.png).

The website is hosted live at freedmand.com/dopenews.

Enjoy,
Dylan
